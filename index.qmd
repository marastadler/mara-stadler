## About me

I am a PhD student at Helmholtz Zentrum München and LMU (Ludwig-Maximilian University) Munich, supervised by [Christian L. Müller](https://www.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/mueller/index.html). My research interests include high-dimensional statistics, with a focus on combinatorial effects, robust feature selection, and applications to high-throughput biological data. I develop statistical workflows that take into account aspects of real-world data and thus provide novel insights in the application domain.
