My research interests include high-dimensional statistics, with a focus on combinatorial effects, robust feature selection, and applications to high-throughput biological data. I develop statistical workflows that take into account aspects of real-world data and thus provide novel insights in the application domain."

    "text": "In this project, we combine chemical biology, biochemical, and proteomic approaches with cell biology and computational analyses to unravel how epigenetic effector molecules can read DNA and histone modification patterns and how they recognise different chromatin modification states. Our goal is to decipher the \"epigenetic code\" by identifying epigenetic reader molecules that can integrate information from multiple chromatin modifications and to understand how these factors operate at the molecular level both in healthy and pathological conditions. \nThis project is done in close collaboration with Dr. Till Bartke from the Institute of Functional Epigenetics at Helmholtz Zentrum München."
